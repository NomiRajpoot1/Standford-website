Your request will only relate to your Personal Information (excluding anonymous or third-party Personal Information) and your request must not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, in particular those of Stanford (e.g., trade secret) or any third party (e.g., intellectual property, recommendation letters that you previously agreed would remain confidential).<\/p>\n<h3>h.
