Computer time-sharing, the first isolation of highly purified stem cells and the first synthesis of biologically active DNA, among many other breakthroughs, all originated at Stanford.<\/p>\n<p>The early years were difficult, however, as even the Stanfords\u2019 wealth proved inadequate to their vision. After her husband\u2019s death, Jane Stanford kept the fledgling university open through her leadership. The 1906 earthquake dealt a further blow, killing two people and destroying several campus buildings, some so new they had never been occupied.<\/p>\n<p>University benefactor and trustee Herbert Hoover, future U.S. president and member of Stanford\u2019s Pioneer Class of 1895, professionalized university operations in the 1920s and helped to put Stanford on a sound financial footing. He founded an institute to collect global political material \u2013 today\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hoover.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hoover Institution<\/a> Library and Archives \u2013 and led the creation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graduate School of Business<\/a>, both now world leaders in their respective fields.<\/p>\n<p>Engineering Professor Frederick Terman, dubbed the \u201cFather of Silicon Valley,\u201d left his stamp by encouraging Stanford students not only to develop but also to commercialize their ideas. In 1937, physicists Russell Varian, Sigurd Varian and William Hansen developed the klystron ultra-high-frequency vacuum tube, paving the way for commercial air navigation, satellite communication and high-energy particle accelerators. In 1939, graduate students William Hewlett and David Packard developed the precision audio oscillator, first low-cost method of measuring audio frequencies, and spun it into the company now known as HP. In 1951, the university developed its Stanford Research Park to house firms led by such innovators. Varian Associates became the first tenants.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter landscape\">\n  \n  <picture >\n    <!--[if IE 9]><video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]-->\n    <source srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/varian.jpg 1400w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/varian-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/varian-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/varian-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/varian-500x335.jpg 500w\" \/>\n    <!--[if IE 9]><\/video><![endif]-->\n    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Varian brothers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" \/>\n  <\/picture>\n  \n  <figcaption>The Varian brothers and William Hansen with the klystron. <span class=\"media-credit\"> (Image credit: Stanford University Archives)<\/span><\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>The post-World War II era saw many research advances.

The 1950s also saw planning of today\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/slac.stanford.edu\">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory<\/a>, managed under license from the U.S. Department of Energy and opened in 1962. The first website in North America went online at SLAC 29 years later. Advances in particle physics developed at SLAC led to the Linac Coherent Light Source, whose ability to capture ultra-fast images of chemical changes at atomic\u00a0scale has made it a global destination for pharmaceutical research. The Cold War also gave rise to \u201cthe Dish,\u201d the radio telescope that is a familiar landmark in the foothills behind campus. The hill housing the Dish is a conservation area open to the public, and more than 2,000 people run or hike \u201cDish Hill\u201d each day.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter landscape\">\n  \n  <picture >\n    <!--[if IE 9]><video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]-->\n    <source srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb.jpg 1533w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-767x512.jpg 767w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-1023x683.jpg 1023w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-575x384.jpg 575w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-1499x1001.jpg 1499w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thedish-webb-500x334.jpg 500w\" \/>\n    <!--[if IE 9]><\/video><![endif]-->\n    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Dish\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" \/>\n  <\/picture>\n  \n  <figcaption>In the foothills above campus, the Dish is a radio telescope built in 1966 and still in use today.

SAIL researchers devised the first interactive system for computer design, as well as pioneering work on computer vision, robotics, laser printing and automated assembly. The world\u2019s first office desktop computer displays appeared at SAIL in 1971.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1970s, Stanford sought new ways to transform society and preserve the environment. It severed its links to classified defense research and forged new paths for service and stewardship. Stanford reduced its dependence on the automobile by adding campus housing and the free Marguerite shuttle, named after a 19th-century horse that pulled a jitney between campus and Palo Alto. The <a href=\"http:\/\/jrbp.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve<\/a> was designated in 1973 to help preserve the green \u201clungs\u201d of the Peninsula and access to the biological data compiled there that helped establish the field of population genetics.<\/p>\n<p>The multidisciplinary <a href=\"http:\/\/shc.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stanford Humanities Center<\/a>, first of its kind in the nation and still the largest, opened in 1980 to advance research into the historical, philosophical, literary, artistic and cultural dimensions of the human experience. At this and 30 other humanities-related centers on campus, scholars ranging from distinguished undergraduates to mid-career fellows create new understandings of the world and humanity\u2019s place in it.<\/p>\n<p>From the start, Stanford has valued experiential education. Generous funding helps its undergraduates of diverse economic backgrounds to enjoy parity of experience and opportunity. In 2015, 85 percent of students received some form of financial assistance and 78 percent of Stanford undergraduates graduated debt-free. More than 1,000 undergraduates conduct faculty-directed research and honors projects each year, while 1,000 take part in <a href=\"https:\/\/haas.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public-service projects<\/a> and 1,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/undergrad.stanford.edu\/programs\/bosp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study overseas<\/a>, all without regard for ability to pay. Since 1992, all undergraduates are guaranteed four years of on-campus housing, in keeping with Stanford\u2019s emphasis on residential education and the experience of a small liberal arts college within the matrix of a large research university.<\/p>\n<p>A significant physical transformation followed the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which again challenged the university\u2019s resilience and vision. Stanford\u2019s main Green Library renovated its heavily damaged west wing as the Bing Wing, while the similarly damaged Stanford Art Museum reopened in 1999 as the <a href=\"https:\/\/museum.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In 1985, the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden opened as the largest collection of Rodin bronzes outside Paris. It became the nexus for a world-class collection of 20th- and 21st-century sculpture, nearly all of it freely accessible to the public. Today, the museum and sculpture garden are part of a Stanford arts district that includes the <a href=\"https:\/\/live.stanford.edu\/media\/videos\/bing-concert-hall-fly-through\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bing Concert Hall<\/a>, the McMurtry Building for experiential arts learning and the acclaimed <a href=\"http:\/\/anderson.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anderson Collection<\/a> of 20th-century American painting.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter landscape\">\n  \n  <picture >\n    <!--[if IE 9]><video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]-->\n    <source srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb.jpg 1533w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-767x512.jpg 767w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-1023x683.jpg 1023w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-575x384.jpg 575w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-1499x1001.jpg 1499w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/anderson_collection_webb-500x334.jpg 500w\" \/>\n    <!--[if IE 9]><\/video><![endif]-->\n    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Anderson Collection\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" \/>\n  <\/picture>\n  \n  <figcaption>The Anderson Collection, which opened in 2014, is one of the world\u2019s most outstanding private assemblies of modern and contemporary American art. <span class=\"media-credit\"> (Image credit: Alex Webb)<\/span><\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>The James H.

Using techniques from design and engineering, the institute, known on campus as the d.school, instills creative confidence and draws students beyond the boundaries of traditional academic disciplines.<\/p>\n<p>Development campaigns of unprecedented scope carry forward the Stanford family\u2019s vision. The 2000 Campaign for Undergraduate Education raised $1 billion, while the Stanford Challenge concluded in 2012 after raising $6.2 billion, then the largest fundraising campaign undertaken by a university, to fund bold new initiatives. Meanwhile, the $1 billion <a href=\"http:\/\/medicalgiving.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Campaign for Stanford Medicine<\/a> is rebuilding Stanford\u2019s two hospitals for adults and children to advance the mission of precision health.<\/p>\n<p>During 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/125.stanford.edu\/\">Stanford celebrated its 125th year<\/a> of transformational impact.
